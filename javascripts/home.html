Welcome to the 2015<sup>th</sup> edition of the yearly <span style="color:blue">Conference on Semantics in Healthcare and Life Sciences</span>.

<h3>History and scope</h3>
For the first time since 2008, CSHALS is being organized as a Special Interrests Group (SIG) of ISMB, the main yearly meeting of the <a href="http://www.iscb.org/" target=_blank>International Society for Computational Biology</a>, in 2015 co-organized with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Conference_on_Computational_Biology" target=_blank>European Conference on Computational Biology</a>: <a href="http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2015" target=_blank>http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2015</a>. With the Semantic Web now becoming a mainstream component of the global Biomedical data space, the time is right to make it part of the main international conference on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. For previous editions of CSHALS see <a href="http://www.iscb.org/iscb-past-conferences#past-cshals" target=_blank>http://www.iscb.org/iscb-past-conferences</a>. From its onset, this conference has been characterized by mixture of contributions from both Academia and Industry, including visionary presentations at the intersection between the two such as those by Tim Berners-Lee and Stephen Wolfram. CSHALS is also known as a venue where core linked data infrastructure, such as EBI's new RDF platform, are previewed. In addition to the keynotes, specialized Tech Talks have been a fixture of CSHALS from its onset. These are short technology talks where data intensive life science companies, from Pharma to emerging Molecular Diagnostics companies, discuss new developments at the frontier of translational research.
